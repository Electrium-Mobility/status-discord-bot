- **Promotes members** through our progression system (Incoming â†’ Active â†’ Previous)
- **Syncs with Google Sheets** to keep everything organized
- **Updates both Discord and our database** when status changes

## ðŸ‘¥ Our Role System

We have three main status roles:

- **ðŸŸ¡ Incoming** - New members who just joined
- **ðŸŸ¢ Active** - Current active members
- **ðŸ”´ Previous** - Former members

## ðŸš€ How to Use

#### Promoting Everyone's Status

When it's time to promote members (like at the end of a semester):

```
!promote
```

This will:

- Move Incoming â†’ Active
- Move Active â†’ Previous
- Remove Previous roles
- Update our Google Sheet automatically

#### Setting Individual Status

To change someone's status manually:

```
!setstatus @username Active
```

Replace `@username` with the person's Discord mention and `Active` with their new status.

#### Manual Sync

If roles get out of sync:

```
!sync_roles
```

This will sync all roles from our Google Sheet to Discord.

## ðŸ“Š Checking Applications
